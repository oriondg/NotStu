Don't miss that ToC on the left!

Goal of this project:

This project is meant to create a Discord bot that could do a variety of things to help with our DnD nights. From calling philibuster to having something for this, it's meant to provide some hijinks.

Beyond that, I want to build this into an interface that's configurable, and to include NLP and RNNs to understand what's being said. I would also like to do this with audio, and analyze what's being said in order to produce a text version, which would then be processed in the same way as the regular text.

Capabilities:

Play youtube videos, tie in with webhooks, and save/reload/reset state.
